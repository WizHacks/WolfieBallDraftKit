A program that intends to cut through all the statistics for MLB baseball players and distill all the draft day decision making into a neatly presented set of sortable and searchable tables that will help any Fantasy Baseball player draft the right team. **Taken from SSR ***Code is not provided but can me made viewable upon request. 

This class was taken with Professor Paul Fodor Spring of 2015 at Stony Brook University.

An existing code base provided by Professor Mckenna at Stony Brook University was referenced while using the JavaFX framework to build the graphical user interface. Other functions of this application include auto drafting, searching, sorting, adding and deleting players. Data was stored and reloaded using JSON data structure.
